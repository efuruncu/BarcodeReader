# BarcodeReader

Firstly, this link(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb7gmrm6z7U) helped me when I was doing this project.
This is a barcode reader project but just read one QR code.
Aim of this project is to reading embedded json data in 2d-code as smooth format.

I embedded this Json data in 2d-code.
{ “Ad”:”Elif Naz”,     “Soyad”:”Furuncu”,    “Bolum”:”Bilgisayar Muhendisligi”,  “Sehir”:Eskisehir”, “Telefon”:”05345910000”   }


İf you want just barcode reader ,you can delete part of json code line. then,application reads every QR code.
